  \textbf{Influence of topology on the self organization.}

  The same initial set of 1024 neurons has been equiped with 2-nearest neighbors, 3 nearest neighbors and 4-nearest neighbors induced topology (panels \textbf{A}, \textbf{B} and \textbf{C} respectively) and trained on 25,000 random RGB colors. This lead to qualitatively different self-organization as shown on panels \textbf{D}, \textbf{E} and \textbf{F} respectively, with major discontinuities in the 2-nearest neighbors case. ).
