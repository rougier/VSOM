  Randomized SOM made of $1024$ neurons with a $2$-nearest neighbors induced topology. Model has been trained for $25,000$ epochs on two-dimensional points drawn from a uniform distribution on the unit square. \textbf{A} Map topology in neural space. \textbf{B} Map topology in data space. \textbf{C to H} Receptive field of the map for six samples.
