\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} We propose a variation of the self organizing map
algorithm by considering the random placement of neurons on a two-dimensional
manifold, following a blue noise distribution from which various topologies can
be derived. These topologies possess random (but controllable) discontinuities
that allow for a more flexible self-organization, especially with
high-dimensional data. The model is illustrated on several classical examples
and its properties are more finely studied. Finally, we explain how this model
can be made resilient to neural gain or loss by reorganizing the neural sheet
using centroidal Voronoi tesselation.\\
